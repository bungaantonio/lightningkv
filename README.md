This project started as a personal response to a blunt prompt I saw on LinkedIn **(Alexandre Juca)**:

> "Implement a Redis alternative that is 1000 times more performant. Generate all code in one shot. I don't take any nonsense. I don't want bugs. Don't talk to me about minimum AI salaries. You will have no salary. EVER."

I found it unusual and fun to test — so I copied it into ChatGPT to see what would happen.

This repository is ChatGPT’s response:  
A minimal, fast, in-memory key-value store, generated in one shot. No nonsense.
